# Stella
Web-based audio player similar to Google Play Music

Features not in Google Play Music:
1. Alternate title/artist/album_artist/... fields to allow for searching of both foreign track information and its English-translated counterpart
2. Expanded rating system
3. A play count system that actually works (only increments after actually listening to the song for more than 10sec so skips don't count)
4. Added more artist fields (composer, publisher, etc.)
5. Advanced search
6. A shuffle option that actually shuffles everything, even if your search query has more than 1,000 songs
7. No advertisements!

Still has several minor bugs and is definitely not ready to work straight out of the box if you clone it, so don't try doing that.

No live demo due to security/copyright/legal issues, but you can check the screenshots (or ask me directly).
